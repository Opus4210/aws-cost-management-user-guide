## Your Cost Explorer Costs<a name="ce-costs"></a>

At the top of the **Cost Explorer** page are the **Month\-to\-date costs** and **Forecasted month end costs**\. The **Month\-to\-date costs** shows you how much you're estimated to have incurred in charges so far this month, and compares it to this time last month\. The **Forecasted month end costs** shows you how much Cost Explorer estimates that you will owe at the end of the month and compares your estimates costs to your actual costs of the previous month\. Neither the **Month\-to\-date costs** nor the **Forecasted month end costs** include refunds\.

## Your Cost Explorer Trends<a name="ce-trends"></a>

In the ***this month* trends** section, Cost Explorer shows you your top cost trends\. For example, your costs related to a specific service have gone up or your costs from a specific type of RI have gone up\. You can see all of your costs trends by choosing **View all trends** in the upper\-right corner of the trend section\.

To understand a trend in more depth, choose it\. Cost Explorer takes you to a Cost Explorer chart that shows the costs that went into calculating that trend\.

## Your Daily Unblended Costs<a name="ce-graph"></a>

In the center of the Cost Explorer dashboard, Cost Explorer shows you a graph of your current unblended daily costs\. You can access the filters and parameters used to create the graph by choosing **Explore costs** in the upper\-right corner\. That takes you to the Cost Explorer report page, enabling you to access the default Cost Explorer reports and modify the parameters used to create the chart\. The Cost Explorer reports offer additional functionality such as downloading your data as a CSV file and saving your specific parameters as a report\. For more information, see [Using Cost Explorer Reports](ce-reports.md)\. Your daily unblended costs don't include refunds\.

## Your Recent Cost Explorer Reports<a name="ce-recent-reports"></a>

At the bottom of the Cost Explorer dashboard is a list of reports that you have looked at recently, when you accessed them, and a link back to the report\. This enables you to switch between reports or remember the reports that you find most useful\.
