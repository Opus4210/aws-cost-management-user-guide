## What's happening?<a name="question-1"></a>

AWS accounts with registered addresses in India will be switched from Amazon Web Services, Inc\. \(AWS\) to Amazon Internet Services Private Limited \(AISPL\)\. AISPL is a local legal Indian entity that acts as a reseller for AWS services in India\.

## Should I expect any AWS service downtime during the change to AISPL?<a name="question-2"></a>

No, there will be no service downtime or interruptions resulting from this change\. Your content, configurations, access rights, and security settings will remain the same\.

## Will I have access to the same AWS services after my account is changed to AISPL?<a name="question-3"></a>

Access to and pricing of AWS services generally will remain the same following the contract change\. However, Amazon DevPay will not be available from AISPL\.

## What will change?<a name="question-4"></a>

Following the switch of your account from AWS to AISPL:
+ Your contract will be with AISPL, and not Amazon Web Services, Inc\. By continuing to use AWS services after the change, you are agreeing to sign up for a new [Customer Agreement with AISPL](https://aws.amazon.com/aispl/agreement/)\. Your Customer Agreement with Amazon Web Services, Inc\. will be terminated and will no longer apply to your account\.
+ Payments to AISPL will be in Indian Rupees \(INR\)\. You will no longer pay for your AWS services in U\.S\. dollars \(USD\)\. 
+ Service tax is owed to Indian tax authorities for services provided by AISPL, and AISPL will begin assessing, collecting, and remitting to the Indian government these taxes during invoicing\. If you are currently self\-assessing a service tax and providing your service tax registration number to Amazon Web Services, Inc\., you will no longer need to do this after switching to AISPL\. 
+ As your transactions with AISPL will be domestic India transactions, you might be required to pay an additional 10% of your invoice amount to the Indian tax authorities as withholding tax, if you so determine\. You might be eligible to receive a refund from AISPL for certain withholding tax amounts paid \(for more information, continue reading this FAQ\)\. 
+ Certain services, such as Amazon DevPay, might not be available from AISPL\.

## What are the benefits to you?<a name="question-5"></a>

India\-based companies find it convenient to purchase AWS services from AISPL for many reasons, including paying in local currency \(INR\) and avoiding foreign currency transaction fees\. Additionally, withholding tax rules and other reporting on invoices and payments to AISPL are more straightforward than transactions with non\-Indian companies\. Finally, as new Indian legislation and proposals might affect taxes on digital businesses and users of cloud services in the future, transactions with India\-based companies can help avoid the uncertainty associated with cross\-border transactions\.

## Which accounts will switch to AISPL?<a name="question-6"></a>

The accounts that will switch are regular accounts that are not part of a consolidated billing structure\.

Generally, all accounts registered with an address in India that are currently served by Amazon Web Services, Inc\. will be changed to AISPL\. You can check the registered address for your account by viewing the contact information on the AWS Management Console, available [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account) and as shown in the following screenshots\.

If your AWS account is part of an organization in the AWS Organizations service, you might be eligible to switch to AISPL\. To be eligible, each account in an organization—the master account and all of its member accounts—must have a registered address in India\. If all accounts within the organization are eligible, then the master account will be changed simultaneously with the member accounts\.

If there are member accounts within an organization with a registered address outside of India, then these will need to be unlinked from the eligible master account before the organization can change to AISPL\.

If any unlinked member accounts will continue to use AWS services under a contract with Amazon Web Services, Inc\., you will need to add a payment method for each unlinked account or link that account to a separate master account \(also under a contract with Amazon Web Services, Inc\.\)\. 

For more information about consolidated billing, see [ Consolidated Billing and AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_from-consolidatedbilling.html)\.

## How do I manage the date for my change to AISPL?<a name="question-7"></a>

We will notify customers of account change dates through email\. If you would like to change this date or request to have your account remain with Amazon Web Services, Inc\., please contact customer support through the [AWS Support Center](http://aws.amazon.com/support)\.

## Will I be able to redeem any unused promotional credits after the change to AISPL?<a name="question-8"></a>

Yes, you can redeem unused promotional credits after the change to AISPL\. Following the acquisition of your account by AISPL, AISPL will be the entity offering such credits to you\. Redeemed credits will be converted from U\.S\. dollars \(USD\) to Indian Rupees \(INR\)\. 

## I am a reseller/APN partner with Amazon Web Services, Inc\. How will this affect me?<a name="question-9"></a>

An AWS representative will contact you to determine the appropriate path to begin procuring services from AISPL\. Or, if you would like to organize a timeline for your account change, please contact customer support through the [AWS Support Center](http://aws.amazon.com/support)\.

## I am a customer with Amazon Web Services, Inc\. and have prepaid balances for my Reserved Instances and domain names\. What will happen to these?<a name="question-10"></a>

The prepaid balances will continue to be available for use following the change\.

## Will there be a new website for AISPL accounts?<a name="question-11"></a>

Not at the present time\. AISPL accounts can be accessed from the current [AWS website](http://aws.amazon.com/)\. When you sign in to the AWS Management Console after the change to AISPL, you will see "Amazon Internet Services Private Ltd\." in the footer\.

## What will my commercial invoice look like after the change to AISPL?<a name="question-12"></a>

Commercial invoices delivered by AISPL will look similar to commercial invoices delivered by Amazon Web Services, Inc\., with the following changes:
+ A greeting from AISPL
+ A statement summary in Indian Rupees \(INR\)
+ Detailed charges, credits and taxes in U\.S\. dollars \(USD\)
+ Conversion rate from U\.S\. dollars \(USD\) to Indian Rupees \(INR\) at the time of invoice creation

## What will my service tax invoice look like?<a name="question-13"></a>

As a customer of AISPL, you will receive a separate, tax\-compliant invoice from AISPL that contains details of the local taxes applicable to your services\. Service tax invoices delivered by AISPL will contain the following:
+ Name and address of AISPL in the invoice footer
+ Customer name, address, and Permanent Account Number \(PAN\)
+ Invoice number
+ Permanent Account Number \(PAN\) of AISPL
+ Service tax registration number of AISPL in the invoice footer
+ Signature of the authorized signatory
+ Detail of applicable services, including the following:
  + Service name
  + Service charge
  + Service tax 
  + Swachh Bharat Cess 
  + Krishi Kalyan Cess 

**Note**  
Customer name, address, and PAN are mandatory for transactions that exceed INR 200,000\.

With this service tax invoice, you might be entitled to claim CENVAT Credit, depending on your eligibility\.

## How do I claim a reimbursement from AISPL for withholding taxes paid to Indian tax authorities?<a name="question-14"></a>

Because your transactions with AISPL will be domestic India transactions, you might be required to pay an additional 10% of your invoice amount to the Indian tax authorities as withholding tax, if you so determine\. You will have the right to claim a reimbursement of this 10% payment from AISPL by furnishing specified documents and information within 90 days of the invoice\. These include the following:
+ A withholding tax certificate \(evidence of the deposit of the amount\)
+ Details of the invoice against which withholding tax has been paid 
+ Your Indian billing address and Permanent Account Number \(PAN\)
+ A copy of the canceled cheque or confirmation of the bank account, including National Electronic Fund Transfer \(NEFT\) details

After providing this documentation and the amounts are confirmed, AISPL will provide a refund\. 

## Will the 6% Equalization levy apply to services from AISPL?<a name="question-15"></a>

No\. The Equalization levy, where applicable, applies only to services provided by non\-resident entities\. Hence, any services provided by AISPL are not subject to the Equalization levy\. 

Currently, cloud services are not included in the scope of the Equalization levy, even for non\-resident entities\. However, this might change in the future\. If this levy were extended to cover cloud services, you could be subject to the levy on the purchase of AWS services from Amazon Web Services, Inc\. 

## Do I have to take any steps to make the change to AISPL?<a name="question-16"></a>

No, each eligible account will change to AISPL automatically upon its scheduled change date\. 

## How can I request to change my account to AISPL earlier?<a name="question-17"></a>

We will notify customers of account change dates via email\. If your account has a registered address in India and is currently served by Amazon Web Services, Inc\., please contact customer support through the [AWS Support Center](http://aws.amazon.com/support) if you would like to change to AISPL earlier\. If your account is part of an organization in the AWS Organizations service, each account in the organization—the master account and all member accounts—must have a registered address in India to be eligible to change to AISPL\. You can check the registered address for your account by viewing the contact information on the AWS Management Console, available [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account)\. 

## Will I be able to see my previous billing records with Amazon Web Services, Inc\. after the change to AISPL?<a name="question-18"></a>

Yes, you will be able to see all previous records and billing history for your account\.

## Will I have the same account number after the change to AISPL?<a name="question-19"></a>

Yes, your account number will remain the same\.

## Will the change to AISPL affect my procurement process?<a name="question-20"></a>

Yes, AISPL is a separate legal entity from Amazon Web Services, Inc\., so your procurement records, including internal accounts payable systems, will need to be updated to reflect AISPL as the provider \(vendor\) of AWS services\. We will provide relevant AISPL billing information in email notifications and in the payment details section of your invoices\.

## I still have a question about the change to AISPL\. Whom do I contact?<a name="question-21"></a>

Please contact your account manager or customer support through the [AWS Support Center](http://aws.amazon.com/support)\.

## What will happen to my Reserved Instances \(RIs\)?<a name="question-22"></a>

There will be no changes to your RIs following the contract change\. For RIs that you have fully paid in advance, no further action is required\. For RIs for which you still receive a monthly invoice \(that is, there was a partial or no upfront payment for the RI\), you will continue to receive a USD invoice from Amazon Web Services, Inc\. until the term expires\. No further action is required\. 

## Are there any special steps for paying AISPL invoices by credit card?<a name="question-23"></a>

You can use the console to pay your AISPL bills\. Credit card payments might require bank verification\. For Visa and MasterCard payment methods, you will be redirected to your bank to verify your payment\. For American Express payment methods, your payment will be processed by your bank, and no additional action from you is required\. To learn more about managing your payments, see [Managing Your Payments in India](edit-aispl-payment-method.md)\.

## Can I postpone having my AWS account switched to the India\-based service provider, or can I have my AWS account excluded from the switch?<a name="question-24"></a>

 Contact the [AWS Support Center](http://aws.amazon.com/support) with a request to either postpone the switch or exclude your account from the switch\. To help us address any concerns you might have about the process, include the reason for your request\.
