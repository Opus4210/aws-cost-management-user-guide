**To view payment methods associated with your AWS account**

You can use the console to view the payment methods associated with your account\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/home\#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose [Payment Methods](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentmethods)\. <a name="designate-default"></a>

**To designate a default payment method**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/home\#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose [Payment Methods](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentmethods)\. 

1. Next to the payment method that you want to use as your default payment method, choose **Make Default**\.<a name="making-a-payment"></a>

**To make a payment**

AWS charges your default payment method automatically at the beginning of each month\. If that charge doesn't process successfully, you can use the console to update your payment method and make a payment\.
**Note**  
If you pay by ACH direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and initiates the charge to your payment method within 10 days of the start of the month\. It can take 3â€“5 days for your payment to succeed\. For more information, see [Managing Your ACH Direct Debit Payment Methods](manage-debit.md)\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/home\#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Payment Methods**\.

1. On the **Payment Methods** page, ensure that the payment method that you want to use is set as your default payment method\.

1. If you are using a credit card, confirm that your card hasn't expired\.

1. Choose **Make a Payment**\. You're redirected to the **Payment History** page\.

1. If your account isn't past due, the **Payment History** page shows only previous invoices and payment status\. You don't need to take any action at this time\.

1. If you see a banner that states that you have an overdue payment, choose **Pay Now** for the invoice that is overdue\.

   If you pay by ACH direct debit and you receive an email from AWS saying that AWS is unable to charge your bank account and will attempt to charge your account again, work with your bank to understand what went wrong\. If you receive an email saying that AWS failed the last attempt to charge your bank account, use the **Pay Now** button on the console to pay your invoice\. If you have questions about issues with charging your bank account or paying an overdue balance, create a case in the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#)\.

   If you pay by electronic funds transfer and your account payment is overdue, create a case in the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#)\.<a name="remove-credit"></a>
