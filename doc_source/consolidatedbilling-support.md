# AWS Support Charges for Accounts in an Organization<a name="consolidatedbilling-support"></a>

AWS calculates AWS Support fees independently for each linked account\. Typically, an AWS Support subscription for a linked account does not apply to the entire organization\. Each account subscribes independently\. Enterprise Support plan customers, however, have the option to include multiple accounts in an aggregated monthly billing\. Monthly charges for the Developer, Business, and Enterprise Support plans are based on each month's AWS usage, subject to a monthly minimum, billed in advance\. AWS Support fees associated with Reserved Instance purchases apply only to the individual accounts that made the purchase\.
